//! Reconnect supervisor (port of src/main/supervisor.js) for the Tauri backend. Owns ONE control
//! backend at a time and respawns ssh on a non-intentional exit (network drop) with capped
//! exponential backoff, reattaching the SAME tmux session — so a dropped connection recovers
//! without restarting the app. tmux keeps the session alive server-side; the client just reattaches.
//!
//! State machine (mirrors the JS supervisor, §5.1/§5.3):
//!   Connecting -> Connected (on first Ready) ; on exit -> Reconnecting (backoff) -> Connecting ;
//!   attempts over the cap -> Dead ; intentional close() -> Closed (no respawn).
//!
//! Testability: the backend factory and the sleep fn are injected, so the policy is unit-tested
//! deterministically without real ssh or real time.

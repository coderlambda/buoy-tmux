# Terminal Notification Dots

**Status:** Implemented · **Date:** 2026-08-06

## 1. Goal

Buoy surfaces terminal notification escape sequences and standalone BEL attention signals as
unread dots:

- a background tmux-window tab that emitted the notification shows a dot;
- its containing session card shows one rollup dot;
- notifications emitted by the currently visible tab are consumed without creating unread state;
- clicking that tab or interacting with its terminal clears its unread state;
- the session dot remains while any other tab in the session is unread;
- after acknowledgement, ordinary output and UI rerenders do not restore the dot—a new,
  complete notification sequence is required.

The UI intentionally shows no notification title, body, history, toast, or native macOS banner.
This feature is an attention locator, not a notification inbox.

## 2. Supported protocols

Buoy recognizes the common terminal notification protocols in the raw PTY stream:

| Protocol | Shape | Completion rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OSC 9 | `ESC ] 9 ; message BEL/ST` | A non-empty, terminated message |
| OSC 777 | `ESC ] 777 ; notify ; title ; body BEL/ST` | A terminated `notify` command |
| OSC 99 | `ESC ] 99 ; metadata ; payload ST` | A title/body chunk whose `d` value is not `0` |
| BEL fallback | `BEL` | A standalone terminal bell reported by xterm |

Both 7-bit (`ESC ]`, `ESC \\`) and 8-bit (`0x9d`, `0x9c`) OSC/ST forms are accepted. BEL is
also accepted as a terminator.

OSC 99 is a chunked protocol. A `d=0` title/body fragment is incomplete and does not create an
unread dot. The final fragment (`d=1`, or omitted because `1` is the protocol default) creates one.
Control and response payloads—`p=close`, `p=alive`, `p=?`, icons, and buttons—do not create dots.

Codex enables TUI notifications by default. Its `auto` method uses OSC 9 only for a small terminal
allowlist and otherwise emits a standalone BEL, normally only after receiving a focus-lost event.
Buoy enables tmux `focus-events` on every attach, so Codex receives the focus reports it expects;
xterm's `onBell` event then feeds the same unread state as OSC notifications. No `~/.codex` change
or Codex-specific wrapper is required.

Claude Code also defaults to an `auto` notification channel, but an unrecognized terminal receives
no terminal notification. Buoy does not identify itself as another terminal or depend on Claude's
native terminal allowlist. Instead, it installs an app-owned launcher at
`$HOME/.cache/buoy/bin/claude` and makes that launcher authoritative inside Buoy shells after the
shell has finished loading the user's startup files. The same bundle contains a small Claude plugin
whose `Notification` and `Stop` hooks write one generic OSC 777 request to the terminal pane running
Claude. Both lifecycle events intentionally collapse to the same boolean unread state; Buoy does
not inspect, retain, or display Claude's hook payload.

The launcher adds the plugin with Claude's repeatable `--plugin-dir` option. Plugin hooks are merged
by Claude independently from settings-file hooks, so existing user/project hooks and every explicit
`--settings` argument remain unchanged. This avoids relying on the undocumented precedence of
multiple `--settings` flags and avoids requiring Node, Python, or `jq` on SSH hosts. A user's native
Claude notification preference may coexist with the plugin; duplicate terminal requests are
idempotent while the tab's unread state is already true.

cmux is different from a settings-file hook: when its Claude integration is enabled, it installs a
managed per-surface `claude` shim and wrapper that owns session tracking and hooks. A cmux context
can be inherited when Buoy is launched from that host, but `BUOY_TERMINAL=1` means the Claude
process now belongs to a Buoy pane. Buoy recognizes cmux's exported
`CMUX_CLAUDE_WRAPPER_SHIM` / `CMUX_CLAUDE_WRAPPER_SHIM_ROOT` contract and managed
`cmux-cli-shims` path, skips that wrapper, and invokes the real Claude binary with only Buoy's
plugin. Conversely, if cmux has already entered Buoy through an older PATH arrangement, cmux's
re-exec/agent-launch marker makes Buoy pass through without adding its plugin. Thus the current
terminal owns exactly one wrapper, and a PATH scrub prevents cycles in already-open shells.

The launcher is deliberately scoped and conservative:

- it is active only when `BUOY_TERMINAL=1` is inherited from a Buoy shell;
- it delegates to the real `claude` executable found later on PATH;
- explicit `--settings` and user `--plugin-dir` arguments are preserved;
- `--safe-mode`, `--bare`, print, help, and version invocations pass through because they either
  disable customizations intentionally or do not represent an interactive agent session;
- `BUOY_CLAUDE_NOTIFICATIONS_DISABLED=1` is an environment-level opt-out;
- Buoy never edits `~/.claude/settings.json`.

Prepending PATH only in the process that starts tmux is insufficient: `.zshenv`, `.zshrc`, shell
frameworks, and version managers may rebuild PATH before the first prompt and place another
`claude` ahead of Buoy. A tmux hook cannot repair that running shell because tmux's environment is
only inherited by processes created later. Buoy therefore installs an app-owned shell launcher and
uses it as the private tmux server's default command:

- **zsh:** a temporary `ZDOTDIR` bootstrap restores the user's real `ZDOTDIR`, sources the real
  `.zshenv`, and schedules a one-shot `precmd`. The hook runs after `.zprofile` and `.zshrc`, then
  prepends Buoy's per-pane shim, clears command hashing, removes a conflicting alias, and installs a
  `claude()` wrapper function.
- **bash:** an app-owned `--rcfile` reproduces interactive login startup by sourcing `/etc/profile`
  and the first user login profile, then performs the same PATH, hash, alias, and function repair.
- **fish:** `--init-command` sources Buoy integration after the user's normal fish configuration.
- **other POSIX interactive shells:** an `ENV` integration provides the PATH and function repair
  when the shell supports the standard interactive startup hook.

The launcher creates a mode-0700 shim under the host's temporary directory, keyed by Buoy session
and tmux pane. The generated shim removes every Buoy temporary-shim directory from PATH before
delegating to the persistent launcher, preventing shim-to-shim recursion. The persistent launcher
continues to skip itself while resolving the real Claude executable. No file in the user's shell or
Claude configuration is edited.

Local sessions install the shell integration, launcher, and plugin before spawning the shell.
Every SSH attach transfers the same dependency-light bundle through the existing connection, then
records the launcher environment and default command in the private tmux server for subsequently
created windows. The transfer still assumes only POSIX `sh` and `base64`; shell-specific files are
data consumed later by the matching shell. Claude launches command hooks in a new session with
pipe-backed stdio, so the hook cannot use `/dev/tty` even though the Claude parent has a controlling
terminal. The hook instead resolves the exact `#{pane_tty}` from inherited `TMUX` and `TMUX_PANE`
metadata. Outside tmux, or if the matching tmux binary is unavailable, it walks a bounded ancestor
chain with POSIX `ps` to find the nearest real tty. Buoy exports the already-probed tmux executable
as an absolute hook dependency, so a user startup file may replace PATH completely without losing
exact pane routing. Write/lookup failures remain non-fatal and report to hook stderr when
`DT_DEBUG=1`.

Writing to the resolved pane tty makes tmux naturally attribute the OSC bytes to the pane running
Claude; no Buoy socket, surface ID, or event-routing service is needed. A shell that was already
running before this feature cannot have its process environment rewritten; open a new Buoy tab or
recreate the session once after upgrading. An already-running Claude process must be restarted to
load the plugin.

## 3. Why OSC parsing happens before xterm

The backend already tags control-mode output with its authoritative tmux window ID. The renderer
therefore scans each raw chunk before forwarding it to xterm:

```text
tmux pane output
  -> Rust control backend resolves pane -> window
  -> session:data { session id, window id, bytes }
  -> tab's OSC notification parser
  -> unread state update
  -> unchanged bytes continue into xterm
```

Parsing inside xterm would be too late for tabs that have not been mounted. Background tabs buffer
display data, but their notification dots must appear immediately. The scan is observational: it
does not remove or rewrite bytes.

Each terminal tab owns its own streaming parser. PTY chunk boundaries are arbitrary, so a sequence
may start in one chunk and end in another. Parser state cannot be shared between tabs because an
unfinished sequence from one tmux window must never consume output from another.

Standalone BEL is the exception: xterm consumes it as a terminal control and reports `onBell`, so
`ui/terminalTab.js` forwards that event to the same per-tab unread transition. A BEL that terminates
an OSC is consumed as the OSC terminator and is not reported as a second standalone bell.

Unterminated input is bounded to 16 KiB. This prevents a hostile or malformed OSC from retaining
an unlimited buffer. A nested OSC introducer recovers parsing at the newer sequence.

## 4. State model

Unread state is ephemeral renderer state; it is not persisted across app restarts.

```text
tab.unreadNotification = false
          |
          | complete OSC 9/99/777 notification or standalone BEL
          | while the tab is not currently visible
          v
tab.unreadNotification = true
          |
          | user clicks that tab header or its visible terminal,
          | or sends input to that terminal
          v
tab.unreadNotification = false
```

Repeated notifications while a tab is already unread keep the same boolean dot. Once the user
clears it, a later complete notification received while the tab is in the background moves it back
to unread. A notification from the active tab in the visible session is already in the user's
attention context and is therefore ignored rather than immediately creating a dot.

The session does not store a second mutable unread flag. Its value is derived every render:

```text
session has unread = any child tab has unreadNotification
```

Derivation prevents the session and its tabs from drifting out of sync. Closing an unread tab
automatically removes its contribution to the session rollup.

## 5. Acknowledgement semantics

Acknowledgement is caused by explicit user attention or terminal input:

- Clicking a native tmux tab clears only that tab, including when it is already active.
- Clicking or tapping inside the visible terminal clears that tab, even if the pointer gesture does
  not send bytes to the pty.
- Keyboard or paste input sent to the visible terminal clears that tab.
- Clicking a session card does not clear native-tab notifications. It reveals the project, after
  which the user can choose the notified tab. This preserves notifications on other tabs.
- Plain/local fallback sessions have one implicit tab and no visible tab strip. Clicking their
  session card acknowledges that sole tab so their dot cannot become impossible to clear.
- Automatic restore, backend-driven active-window changes, incoming output, automatic terminal
  protocol replies, rename, reconnect, and unrelated rerenders never acknowledge a notification.

No timer clears unread state. A dot remains until its user acknowledgement or until the emitting
tab/session is closed.

## 6. Visual design

Notification state uses a 7 px circular dot in the existing accent blue:

- inside the session name row for the session rollup;
- inside the tab label for the per-tab state.

The existing session connection-status dot remains separate. Connection state answers whether the
transport is healthy; the notification dot answers whether a child terminal asked for attention.
No message content is rendered or exposed in a tooltip.

## 7. Trust and security

Terminal output is untrusted. Any process that can write an OSC notification or BEL to the pane can
create a dot. Therefore a notification:

- may only affect ephemeral unread presentation state;
- does not run a command;
- does not grant or deny an agent permission;
- does not send input back to the terminal;
- does not display attacker-controlled title/body text in Buoy chrome.

Future actionable approvals require an authenticated, request-correlated agent channel. They must
not reuse this OSC dot as proof that a real agent issued a permission request.

## 8. Implementation map

- `ui/builtinPlugins.js` owns the pure streaming parser and OSC classification.
- `ui/terminalTab.js` forwards xterm's standalone BEL event.
- `ui/renderer.js` owns per-tab unread state, session aggregation, and acknowledgement behavior.
- `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/validation.rs` enables tmux focus events on every local/remote attach.
- `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/claude_integration.rs` provisions the scoped Claude Code launcher/plugin bundle and
  post-startup zsh/bash/fish/POSIX integration locally and over SSH while preserving explicit user
  configuration. The remote bootstrap is decoded inside command substitution and passed as
  `/bin/sh -c`'s argument—not piped into the shell's stdin—so the final tmux `exec` retains the pty
  allocated by `ssh -tt` and can start its control handshake.
- `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/transport.rs` exposes the shell launcher, real shell identity, session identity,
  initial launcher PATH, and Buoy marker to local tmux windows. The initial PATH remains a fallback;
  the post-startup integration is authoritative.
- `apps/desktop/ui/index.html` owns the shared dot styling.
- `test/plugins.test.js` covers protocol classification and arbitrary chunk boundaries.
- `test/gui-notifications.js` covers the real renderer behavior and DOM rollup/clearing rules.

| User rc file prepends a competing `claude` | First prompt repairs lookup; Buoy launcher still runs |
| Custom zsh `ZDOTDIR` | User startup files load once from the original directory; Buoy hook runs afterwards |
| zsh `noclobber` or a stale generated shim | Per-pane shim is atomically refreshed without startup noise |
| Nested/competing Buoy shim entries on PATH | Generated shim removes all temporary entries and cannot recurse |
| New tmux window after reconnect | tmux default command launches the same post-rc integration |
| Claude Code with explicit `--settings` or another `--plugin-dir` | User arguments are unchanged; Buoy hook also loads |
| Claude Code with an explicit native notification channel | Native channel and idempotent Buoy hook may coexist |
| Claude Code with cmux's managed shim on PATH | Buoy skips cmux inside its pane; exactly one Buoy plugin, no wrapper cycle |
